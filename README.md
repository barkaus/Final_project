Latitude and longitude comparisons of salinity and temperature in the Atlantic Ocean

Description:
The goal of this project was to examine the difference in surface temperature and salinity across the Atlantic Ocean at different latitudes and longitudes. A variety of datasets were used which would generally isolate longitude or latitude. This was done to quantify the change in surface temperature or salinity. Of particular interest is the change of these variables longitudinally, as the Atlantic Ocean sees a different gradient of change latitudinally at different longitudes. Analysis is done on the graphs to explain trends and differences in the data.
Data and Analysis:
All data was taken from CCHDO and collected via CTD instruments. 
Longitude:
The first 3 data sets shown are at varying steady latitudes. The labels for each represent the latitude each data set falls on. Interestingly, the waters further east tend to always be colder. The big spikes in temperature near the coastlines are interesting, likely due to the cold water current which works upward from the southern tip of Africa.
Looking at salinity, there is not as much change based on latitude as compared to temperature. The furthest north latitude has the highest salinity, as the other locations likely experience higher measures of rainfall. The large dip in the green line for -5 degree latitude is likely due to the exit of the Congo river into the Atlantic, introducing a large amount of freshwater.
Looking at the salinity vs temperature trend, there is a slight trend up and right, as the two properties have some relation, however salinity is impacted on the surface differently at these latitudes, so no clear connection can be made. 


Latitude:
	These graphs show the heavy influence of latitude on the two properties is very clear way. Higher temperatures occur at lower latitudes declines steadily with increasing or decreasing latitude. The coldest waters occur off the coast of Antarctica. 
Salinity also follows a similar trend, however with a large dip at the low latitudes due to a larger influx in rain and evaporation. 
	There is a greater degree of connection between salinity and temperature in this case as well, as both salinity and temperature tend to increase together, except at the low latitude section. 
Further Work:
	I would like to look at other varying latitudes and longitudes, unfortunately many of the data sets were not available for many of the other cruises. Attempt was made to analyze a short cruise with varying latitude and longitude, however no significant conclusions or meaningful data was drawn outside of what had already been concluded.
